        <h2>INDIAN ARCHITECTURE </h2>
        <p>Destination Name:<b> DELHI</b></p>
        <p>Location:<b> INDIA </b>  </p>
        <p>Brief Description:<br>
            <br>
            Mughal architecture is all about those intricate designs, <br>
            like those mesmerizing geometric patterns and those onion-like domes on their buildings. <br>
            And they loved using marble and red sandstone for that elegant look.<br>
            <br>
            
            <b>Taj Mahal</b> in Agra:
            For his cherished wife Mumtaz, the emperor Shah Jahan constructed a magnificent white marble mausoleum.<br>
             Visitors come here to enjoy its breathtaking beauty and to experience the romance that inspired it. <br>
             Amazing carvings and color-changing effects in response to sunshine.<br>
            <br>


        
            
            
            <b> Red Fort</b> in Delhi:
        

The Red Fort, as its name suggests, is a sizable fort in Delhi.<br>
 It was once the Mughal rulers' primary residence. <br>
 The architecture is remarkable, with its tall walls and lovely gates.<br> 
 It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a fantastic location to learn about history.<br>
 <br>

 <b> Qutub Minar </b>in Delhi:
            
 Similar to a huge tower, Delhi's Qutub Minar.<br>
  It has a long historyâ€”more than 800 years, in fact.<br>
   The tallest brick minaret in the world, according to some. <br>
   It has these beautiful, detailed sculptures, and you can even climb to the top for a stunning view over Delhi.<br>
  It's like a history class with a little exercise thrown in.<br>
